I am delighted to announce that I have been granted the opportunity to participate in the NASA Internship Program for the summer of 2023. As a passionate individual in the field of Computer Science and Data Analysis, I am honored to have been selected for this esteemed internship.

With diligence and perseverance, I have developed my skills in these areas over the years, and I am eager to apply them towards contributing to the CCRI Volcanic Emission Impacts on Climate Systems, Agriculture, and Society project. I am confident that this internship will provide me with invaluable knowledge and experience, and I look forward to collaborating with the distinguished professionals at NASA to make meaningful contributions towards this initiative.

Designed based on ergonomics, the Majextand not only protects the cervical spine during use but also promotes better heat dissipation for the laptop. Unlike conventional stands, which are often bulky and inconvenient for daily use, the Majextand is slim, lightweight, and user-friendly. It can raise the laptop between 7cm and 12cm, with 6 adjustable height settings to suit various situations, such as typing, watching videos, or aligning the laptop with an external display.

The Majextand is incredibly thin, measuring only 1.7mm—thinner than a 25-cent coin—making it barely noticeable when attached to the laptop. This ultra-slim design ensures that carrying your laptop with the Majextand attached won't be a burden.

At first, I was concerned that the stand might be too high, but that hasn't been an issue. I typically use it at the 7cm setting for typing and other tasks, but sometimes switch to the 12cm height for a better viewing angle when watching videos or connecting to an external display.

Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the Majextand. Its ergonomic design, versatility, and slim profile make it an ideal laptop stand for daily use, and I  recommend it to anyone seeking a comfortable, stylish, and practical solution for their laptop.
